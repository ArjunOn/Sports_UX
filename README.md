# Sports Application UX Project

Welcome to the repository for the **Sports Application UX Project**! This project was designed as part of a UX/UI bootcamp course, focusing on creating a user-friendly and engaging sports application. The goal is to understand user needs, design a seamless user journey, and provide an engaging interface for sports enthusiasts.

## Project Overview
This project follows a user-centered design approach, with each step documented in Figma for clarity and transparency. The key deliverables include an empathy map, user personas, information architecture, and high-fidelity UI designs, which help map out the project from understanding user needs to developing the final user interface.
